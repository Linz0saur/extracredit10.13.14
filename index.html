        <h1>Munchkin Cats</h1>
        <img width="100%" height="100%" src="img/Munchkin-cat.jpg" />
        <p>The Munchkin is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very <em><b>short legs</b></em>, which are caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation. Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The <i>International Cat Association</i> in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues.</p>
        
            <p>The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show held by <strong>The International Cat Association</strong><small>(TICA)</small>  in Madison Square Garden.Critics predicted that the breed would develop back, hip and leg problems similar to those that plague some Dachshunds.Amidst much controversy, the Munchkin was proposed as a new breed by foundation breeders Laurie Bobskill and Robert Bobskill of Massachusetts and accepted by <small>TICA</small> into its New Breed development program in September 1994. One veteran show judge resigned in protest, calling the breed an affront to breeders with ethics.The Munchkin achieved <small>TICA</small> Championship status in May 2003.</p>
            
        
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shorter than  average legs</li>
            <li>Small to medium in size</li>
            <li>Average weight 4-9 pounds</li>
            <li>Playful</li>
            <li>People-oriented</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>Although the genetic mutation causing the short-legged trait in Munchkins has been referred to as <i>achondroplasia</i>,achondroplasia is typically associated with an enlarged head as well as short legs.This combination of features is not seen in Munchkin cats. The condition has sometimes been referred to as hypochondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia.Small litter sizes when two munchkin cats are crossed indicate that embryos that are homozygous for the munchkin gene are non-viable.</p>
        <h4>Genetics</h4>
        <p>The munchkin gene is autosomal dominant.Homozygous embryos for the munchkin gene are not viable due to gene lethality, and do not develop in the womb. Only kittens that are heterozygous for the munchkin gene develop into viable short legged munchkin kittens.Because only heterozygous munchkin cats are able to pass on the gene, all litters with at least one munchkin parent have the possibility of containing kittens with the phenotypes: short-legged or normal-legged (referred to as non-standard munchkin), with the genotypes of Mm or mm, where M is the trait for short legs and m is the trait for long legs. A litter with two munchkin parents, Mm x Mm, have the chance of producing these offspring: 25% MM- a nonviable kitten, 50% Mm-short-legged, 25% mm- normal.</p>
